<h1>Things I Do</h1>
<p>These are the projects that I am working/worked upon:</p>

<div class="project">
    <h1 class="name">Topological Data Analysis on Dynamic graphs</h1>
    <span class="duration">Feb - April 2019</span><br>
    <span class="description">Course project for Computational Geometry and Topology. Worked on TDA on time-varying graphs. Extracting persistence diagrams of each snapshot and comparing their paiwise Bottleneck/Wasserstein distances. Obtained a timeline plotting first dimension of classical MDS against time. This gave us the insight of the variations in the data over time. Also helps in finding one-time events. Used TDA libraries like: Gudhi, Dionysus 2, TDA package in R, etc.<span>

<div class="project">
    <h1 class="name">1D Landscape Profile</h1>
    <img class="img_right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/projects/landscape_profile.png"></img>
    <span class="duration">Oct - Nov 2018</span><br>
    <span class="description">This was the Graphics and Visualization course project, which I took in my first semester of MTech at IISc, Bangalore. The aim was to construct a landscape profile for a given input augmented join tree. The join tree could have been extracted from 3D scalar field volume, 2D scalar field grid, clustering data, or any data from any other domain. Python was used for converting the input as a JSON file. d3.js javascript library was used for generating the intended landscape profile, as SVG on the browser. Aimed at visualization and analysis of high-dimensional data.<span>

<div class="project">
    <h1 class="name">Space Rangers</h1>
    <img class="img_left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/projects/space_rangers.png"></img>
    <span class="duration">June 2017</span><br>
    <span class="description">Space Rangers is a 3D WebGL game that I developed during my internship at IIT Bombay. This game inspires user to answer maths questions as quickly as possible, in order to win the race. The questions are fetched from a JSON file which can be changed to have your own set of MCQ questions. The game was written in javascript without any game engine or framework used. The only javascript library used was three.js for handling WebGL. Play the game <a href="https://ekshikha-gamificationframework.github.io/Space-Ranger/index.html">here</a>(desktop version). Source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/ekShikha-GamificationFramework/Space-Ranger">github</a>.<span>

<div class="project">
    <h1 class="name">Pac-Man Maths Game</h1>
    <img class="img_right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/projects/pacman.png"></img>
    <span class="duration">June 2017</span><br>
    <span class="description">This game was developed during the internship at IITB, with the purpose of testing the gamification framework. This game is inspired by the classic Pac-Man game. The player is given a maths problem and 5 seconds time to solve that question. After the time ends, the player has to control the Pac-Man to reach to the correct answer ball. And of course escaping from the ghosts. The ghosts(two of four) follows the Pac-Man. It serches for the shortest path to Pac-Man. Play the game <a href="https://ekshikha-gamificationframework.github.io/Pac-Man-Maths-Game/">here</a>(desktop version). Source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/ekShikha-GamificationFramework/Pac-Man-Maths-Game">github</a>.<span>

    <h1 class="name">Space Drift</h1>
    <img class="img_left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/projects/test.gif"></img>
    <span class="duration">Jan 2017</span><br>
    <span class="description">Space Drift is an Android Game which I developed during my 5th semester of college. This game is a simple one tap infinite game, in which user have to tap the screen to change the direction of the spaceship. The spaceship always keeps rotating in either left or right. You have to protect it from colliding with the spherical asteroids moving around randomly. I built this game as a learning experience. No game engine or framework was used. Everything was done from scratch. I used Android Studio for the whole project. The game does not contain any images, everything is drawn from the basic primitives available as canvas methods. The challenging part was implementing collision detection, for which I used SAT(Separating Axis Theorem). <a href="https://github.com/mr-easy/SpaceDrift">Source code</a>.<span>

<div class="project">
    <h1 class="name">Personal Website</h1>
    <span class="duration">June 2017 - present</span><br>
    <span class="description">This website. Created using Jekyll and hosted (with love) on github pages. Aim of creating this was to have a personal space on the web, and also to showcase what I create. And also to write some things. It is under construction and a lot of work is to be done.

<div class="project">
    <h1 class="name">CPU Process Scheduling</h1>
    <span class="duration">November 2016</span><br>
    <span class="description">This project was developed during my OS classes, so as to learn the different process scheduling algorithms. These include FCFS, SRTF, Priority Scheduling, Round-Robin. This was written in C++. The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/mr-easy/process_scheduling">github</a>.<span>

    <center><h1 class="name">Animations</h1></center>
		<span class="description">I love creating animations as a hobby. Mostly I prefer doing it the traditional way, i.e by drawing each frame. The software that I use is <a href="https://www.pencil2d.org/">pencil2D</a>. It's a nice and simple open-source tool for creating short length animations. I also use Wacom One (small) graphics pen tablet for drawing.</span>
