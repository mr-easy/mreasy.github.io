    <span class="description">Space Drift is an Android Game which I developed during my 5th semester of college.
        This game is a simple one tap infinite game, in which user have to tap the screen to change the direction of the spaceship.
        The spaceship always keeps rotating in either left or right. You have to protect it from colliding with the spherical asteroids moving around randomly.
        I built this game as a learning experience. No game engine or framework was used. Everything was done from scratch. I used Android Studio for the whole project.
        The game does not contain any images, everything is drawn from the basic primitives available as canvas methods.
        The challenging part was implementing collision detection, for which I used SAT(Separating Axis Theorem).<span>
